# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The AumOS platform team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your
efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report

Email your findings to: **security@aumos.io**

Include in your report:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
- Your recommended fix (if you have one)

You will receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours** and a detailed response
within **5 business days**.

## Scope

The following are in scope for security reports:

- Authentication and authorization bypass
- Tenant isolation violations (RLS bypass, cross-tenant data access)
- SQL injection or other injection attacks
- Remote code execution
- Sensitive data exposure (credentials, PII, tenant data, model artifacts)
- Privilege escalation
- API security issues (broken object-level authorization, rate limiting bypass)
- MLflow experiment namespace cross-tenant leakage
- Feature store data isolation failures
- Deployment credential exposure

The following are out of scope:

- Denial of service attacks
- Social engineering of AumOS staff
- Physical security issues
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services we do not control (MLflow server, Feast registry)
- Issues in repositories not owned by AumOS Enterprise

## Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Initial assessment | Within 5 business days |
| Status update | Every 7 days during investigation |
| Fix deployment (critical) | Within 7 days of confirmation |
| Fix deployment (high) | Within 30 days of confirmation |
| Fix deployment (medium/low) | Next scheduled release |

## Disclosure Policy

- We follow a **90-day coordinated disclosure** policy
- We will notify you when the fix is deployed
- We will credit you in our release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have released a fix

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this repository:

1. Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials (even test credentials)
2. Use parameterized queries — never string concatenation in SQL
3. Validate all inputs at system boundaries using Pydantic
4. Never log sensitive data (tokens, passwords, PII, model artifact URIs)
5. Check dependency licenses and security advisories before adding packages
6. Ensure MLflow experiment namespaces always include the tenant_id prefix
7. Never expose internal MLflow run IDs or Feast entity keys to unauthorized tenants
8. Report any security issues you discover, even if you are not sure of the impact
